### **Basic fastapi + alembic (async postgres) template**

V 1.0

----

This is free to use fastapi template from @n1kkj

I personally used it in many of my projects, including fully working sites, services in big micro-service structures, telegram bots and more!

It uses uvicorn and docker to run, the command for start and restart:

```
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate
```

And to stop containers:
```
docker compose down
```

Contact me in telegram if you have any suggestions or questions.
